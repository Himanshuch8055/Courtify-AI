# Welcome to Your New Create React App Project!

Congratulations on starting your new project! This guide will help you get up and running with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Overview

This project is a modern web application built with React, utilizing various powerful libraries and tools to enhance development and user experience. Below is a brief overview of the key components and dependencies used in this project:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Framer Motion**: A library for creating animations.
- **React Icons**: A collection of popular icons.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Google Generative AI**: An AI tool for generating content.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

This command launches the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

This command starts the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
For more information, see the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

This command builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

For more information, see the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and medium-sized deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Project Structure

Here's a quick overview of the project's structure:

- **src/**: Contains the source code of the application.
  - **components/**: Reusable components like Header, Footer, Body, and ChatWidget.
  - **page/**: Main page of the application.
  - **App.js**: The root component that renders the Main page.
  - **index.js**: Entry point of the application.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Chat Widget**: Powered by Google Generative AI, providing real-time responses.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the application looks great on all devices.
- **Animations**: Smooth and engaging animations using Framer Motion.
- **Filtering**: Easily filter chat messages.
